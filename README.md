# Amazon-Clone
<p>
About-I recently completed a web development project where I designed a clone of the Amazon homepage using HTML and CSS. The goal was
 to replicate the familiar layout and features of the Amazon website, allowing users to experience a similar interface.

In my project, I meticulously crafted the header section, including the Amazon logo, delivery address, search bar, sign-in links, and
 the shopping cart icon. I also paid attention to responsive design, ensuring that the page looks great on various screen sizes.

The hero background image, reminiscent of Amazonâ€™s iconic banner, sets the tone for the entire page. I used CSS to style the navigation 
bar, buttons, and text elements, aiming for a polished and professional appearance.

While this clone is not functional for actual shopping, it serves as a valuable exercise in front-end development. I learned how to
 structure HTML elements, apply CSS styles, and create an engaging user interface. Overall, building this Amazon-inspired homepage 
 clone was both challenging and rewarding, and it deepened my understanding of web design principles.</p>
